LTC4155: Dual-Input Power Manager / 3.5A Li-Ion Battery Charger with I²C Control and USB OTG

@verbatim
The LTC®4155 is a 15 watt I²C controlled power manager with PowerPath™ instant-
on operation, high efficiency switching battery charging and USB compatibility.
The LTC4155 seamlessly manages power distribution from two 5V sources, such as a
USB port and a wall adapter, to a single-cell rechargeable Lithium-Ion/Polymer
battery and a system load.
