LTC2308: 16-bit 8-channel 100ksps ADC

@verbatim

The LTC2308 is an 8-channel 12-bit A/D converter with
with serial I/O, and an internal reference. The ADCs typically draw only 1.3mA
from a single 5V supply. The 8-channel input multiplexer can be configured for
either single-ended or differential inputs and unipolar or bipolar conversions
(or combinations thereof). The automatic nap and sleep modes benefit power
sensitive applications.

The LTC2308's DC performance is outstanding with a +/-2LSB INL specification and
no missing codes over temperature. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the
LTC2308 is typically 89dB, with the internal reference.

SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                           Byte #2
Data Out :  D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10  D9  D8    D7  D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0
Data In  :  SD  OS  S1  S0  UNI GAIN NAP SLP   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X

SD   : Single/Differential Bit
OS   : ODD/Sign Bit
Sx   : Address Select Bit
UNI  : Unipolar/Bipolar Bit

Example Code:

Read Channel 0 in Single-Ended Unipolar mode when input is with respect to GND

    adc_command = LTC2308_CH0 | LTC2308_UNIPOLAR_MODE | LTC2308_LOW_GAIN_MODE | LTC2308_NORMAL_MODE;     // Single-ended, CH0, unipolar, low gain, normal mode.
    LTC2308_read(LTC2308_CS, adc_command, &adc_code);   // Throws out last reading
    LTC2308_read(LTC2308_CS, adc_command, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2308_unipolar_code_to_voltage(adc_code, LTC2308_lsb, LTC2308_offset_unipolar_code);
