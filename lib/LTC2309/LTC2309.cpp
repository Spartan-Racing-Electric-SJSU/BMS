LTC2309: 8-channel, 12-Bit SAR ADC with I2C interface
LTC2301: 1-Channel, 12-Bit ADCs with I2C Compatible Interface

@verbatim

The LTC2309 is a low noise, low power, 8-channel, 12-bit successive
approximation ADC with an I2C compatible serial interface. This ADC includes an
internal reference and a fully differential sample-and-hold circuit to reduce
common mode noise. The LTC2309 operates from an internal clock to achieve a fast
1.3 microsecond conversion time.

The LTC2309 operates from a single 5V supply and draws just 300 microamps at a
throughput rate of 1ksps. The ADC enters nap mode when not converting, reducing
the power dissipation.

// Construct a channel / uni/bipolar by bitwise ORing one choice from the channel configuration
// and one choice from the command.

// Example - read channel 3 single-ended

// Example - read voltage between channels 5 and 4 with 4 as positive polarity and in bipolar mode.
// adc_command = LTC2309_P4_N5 | LTC2309_BIPOLAR_MODE;
