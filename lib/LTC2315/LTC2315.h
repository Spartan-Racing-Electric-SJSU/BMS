The following parts (DUT) are pin-compatible, 12/14-bit A/D converters with serial I/O, and an internal reference:
LTC2312-12: 12-Bit, 500Ksps ADC.
LTC2312-14: 14-Bit, 500Ksps ADC.
LTC2313-12: 12-Bit, 2.5Msps ADC
LTC2313-14: 14-Bit, 2.5Msps ADC
LTC2314-14: 14-Bit, 4.5Msps ADC
LTC2315-12: 12-Bit, 5Msps ADC

Example Code:

Read ADC input.

    LTC2315_read(LTC2315_CS, &adc_code);   // Throws out last reading
    LTC2315_read(LTC2315_CS, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2315_code_to_voltage(adc_code, vref);
