The following parts (DUT) are pin-compatible, 16/18-bit A/D converters with serial I/O, and an internal reference:
LTC2326-16: 16-Bit, 250ksps Pseudo-differential input ADC.
LTC2326-18: 18-Bit, 250ksps Pseudo-differential input ADC.
LTC2327-16: 16-Bit, 500ksps Pseudo-differential input ADC
LTC2327-18: 18-Bit, 500ksps Pseudo-differential input ADC
LTC2328-16: 16-Bit, 1Msps Pseudo-differential input ADC

LTC2336-18: 18-Bit, 250ksps Fully-differential input ADC
LTC2337-18: 18-Bit, 500ksps Fully-differential ADC
LTC2338-18: 18-Bit, 1Msps Fully-differential input ADC

Example Code:

Read ADC input.

    LTC2338_read(LTC2338_CS, &adc_code);   // Throws out last reading
    LTC2338_read(LTC2338_CS, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2338_code_to_voltage(adc_code, vref);
