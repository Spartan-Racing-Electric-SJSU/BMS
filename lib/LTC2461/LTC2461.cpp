LTC2461: 16-Bit I2C Delta Sigma ADCs with 10ppm/C Max Precision Reference.
LTC2463: Differential, 16-Bit I2C Delta Sigma ADCs with 10ppm/C Max Precision Reference.
LTC2453: Differential, 16-Bit Delta Sigma ADC With I2C Interface.

@verbatim

The LTC2461/LTC2463 are ultra tiny, 16-Bit analog-to-digital converters with an
integrated precision reference. They use a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply and
communicate through an I2C Interface. The LTC2461 is single-ended with a 0V to
1.25V input range and the LTC2463 is differential with a 1.25V input range. Both
ADCs include a 1.25V integrated reference with 2ppm/C drift performance and 0.1%
initial accuracy. The converters are available in a 12-pin 3mm x 3mm DFN package
or an MSOP-12 package. They include an integrated oscillator and perform
conversions with no latency for multiplexed applications. The LTC2461/LTC2463
include a proprietary input sampling scheme that reduces the average input
current several orders of magnitude when compared to conventional delta sigma
converters
