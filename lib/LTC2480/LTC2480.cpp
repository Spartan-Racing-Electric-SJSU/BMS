LTC2480: 16-Bit Delta-Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation.

@verbatim

The LTC2480 is a 16-Bit Delta-Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation.
It includes on-chip programmable gain and an oscillator. The LTC2480 can be
configured to provide a programmable gain from 1 to 256 in 8 steps, measure an
external signal or internal temperature sensor and reject line frequencies. 50Hz,
60Hz or simultaneous 50Hz/60Hz line frequency rejection can be selected as well
as a 2x speed-up mode.
