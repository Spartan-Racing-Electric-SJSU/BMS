LTC2482: 16-Bit Delta-Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation.

@verbatim

The LTC2480 is a 16-Bit Delta-Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation.
The LTC2482 allows a wide common mode input range (0V to VCC) independent of the
reference voltage. The reference can be as low as 100mV or can be tied directly to
VCC. The noise level is 600nV RMS independent of VREF . This allows direct
digitization of low level signals with 16-bit accuracy. The LTC2482 includes an on-chip
trimmed oscillator, eliminating the need for external crystals or oscillators and
provides 87dB rejection of 50Hz and 60Hz line frequency noise. Absolute accuracy and low
drift are automatically maintained through continuous, transparent, offset and
full-scale calibration.

Example Code:

Read ADC input.

    LTC2482_read(LTC2482_CS, &adc_code);   // Throws out last reading
    LTC2482_read(LTC2482_CS, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

  display_code = adc_code >> 4;
    display_code = display_code & 0xFFFF;

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2482_code_to_voltage(display_code, vref);
