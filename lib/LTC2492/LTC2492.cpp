LTC2492: 24-Bit, 4-Channel Delta Sigma ADCs with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation
@verbatim

The LTC2492 is a 4-channel (2-differential) 24-bit No Latency Delta Sigma
TM ADC with Easy Drive technology. The patented sampling scheme eliminates
dynamic input current errors and the shortcomings of on-chip buffering
through automatic cancellation of differential input current. This allows
large external source impedances, and rail-to-rail input signals to be
directly digitized while maintaining exceptional DC accuracy.
