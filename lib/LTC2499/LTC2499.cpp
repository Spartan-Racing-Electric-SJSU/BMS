LTC2499: 24-Bit, 16-Channel Delta Sigma ADCs with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation

@verbatim

The LTC2499 is a 16-channel (eight differential), 24-bit, No Latency DS TM
ADC with Easy Drive technology and a 2-wire, I2C interface. The patented
sampling scheme eliminates dynamic input current errors and the
shortcomings of on-chip buffering through automatic cancellation of
differential input current. This allows large external source impedances
and rail-to-rail input signals to be directly digitized while maintaining
exceptional DC accuracy.
