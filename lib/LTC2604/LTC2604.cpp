LTC2604: Quad 16-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs in 16-Lead SSOP

@verbatim

The LTC2604/LTC2614/LTC2624 are quad 16-,14- and 12-bit 2.5V to 5.5V
rail-to-rail voltage output DACs in 16-lead narrow SSOP packages. These
parts have separate reference inputs for each DAC. They have built-in
high performance output buffers and are guaranteed monotonic.

These parts establish advanced performance standards for output drive,
crosstalk and load regulation in single-supply, voltage output multiples.
