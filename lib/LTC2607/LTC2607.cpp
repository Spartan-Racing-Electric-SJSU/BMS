LTC2607: 16-Bit, Dual Rail-to-Rail DACs with I2C Interface.
LTC2609: Quad 16-/14-/12-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs with I²C Interface.
LTC2606: 16-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs with I²C Interface.

@verbatim

The LTC2607/LTC2617/LTC2627 are dual 16-, 14- and 12-bit, 2.7V to 5.5V
rail-to-rail voltage output DACs in a 12-lead DFN package. They have built-in
high performance output buffers and are guaranteed monotonic.

These parts establish new board-density benchmarks for 16- and 14-bit DACs and
advance performance standards for output drive and load regulation in single-
supply, voltage-output DACs.

The parts use a 2-wire, I2C compatible serial interface. The
LTC2607/LTC2617/LTC2627 operate in both the standard mode (clock rate of 100kHz)
and the fast mode (clock rate of 400kHz). An asynchronous DAC update pin (LDAC)
is also included.

The LTC2607/LTC2617/LTC2627 incorporate a power-on reset circuit. During power-
up, the voltage outputs rise less than 10mV above zero scale; and after power-
up, they stay at zero scale until a valid write and update take place. The
power-on reset circuit resets the LTC2607-1/LTC2617-1/ LTC2627-1 to mid-scale.
The voltage outputs stay at midscale until a valid write and update takes place.
