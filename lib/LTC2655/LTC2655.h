LTC2655: Quad I2C 16-/12-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs with 10ppm/C Max Reference

@verbatim

The LTC2655 is a family of Quad I2C 16-/12-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs with
integrated 10ppm/C max reference. The DACs have built-in high performance,
rail-to-rail, output buffers and are guaranteed monotonic. The LTC2655-L has a
full-scale output of 2.5V with the integrated reference and operates from a
single 2.7V to 5.5V supply. The LTC2655-H has a full-scale output of 4.096V with
the integrated reference and operates from a 4.5V to 5.5V supply. Each DAC can
also operate with an external reference, which sets the full-scale output to 2
times the external reference voltage.

The parts use the 2-wire I2C compatible serial interface. The LTC2655 operates
in both the standard mode (maximum clock rate of 100kHz) and the fast mode
(maximum clock rate of 400kHz). The LTC2655 incorporates a power-on reset
circuit that is controlled by the PORSEL pin. If PORSEL is tied to GND the DACs
power-on reset to zero-scale. If PORSEL is tied to VCC, the DACs power-on reset
to mid-scale.

D11 D10 D9  D8  D7  D6  D5 D4 SACK  D3 D2 D1 D0 X  X  X  X  SACK  STOP

START: I2C Start
SAx  : I2C Address
W    : I2C Write (0)
SACK : I2C Slave Generated Acknowledge (Active Low)
Cx   : DAC Command Code
Ax   : DAC Address (0=DACA, 1=DACB, 2=DACC, 3=DACD, 0xFF=All DACs)
Dx   : DAC Data Bits
X    : Don't care
STOP : I2C Stop


Example Code:

Set DAC A to to 2V for 16-bit DAC.

    shift_count = 0;    // 16-bit DAC does not have to be shifted
    dac_voltage = 2.0;  // Sets dac voltage variable to 2v

    dac_code = LTC2655_voltage_to_code(dac_voltage, LTC2655_lsb, LTC2655_offset);   // Calculate DAC code from voltage, lsb, and offset
    ack = LTC2655_write(LTC2655_I2C_ADDRESS, LTC2655_CMD_WRITE_UPDATE, LTC2655_DAC_A, dac_code);    // Set DAC A with DAC code
