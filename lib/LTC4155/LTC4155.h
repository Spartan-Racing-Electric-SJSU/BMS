LTC4155: Dual-Input Power Manager / 3.5A Li-Ion Battery Charger with I²C Control and USB OTG

@verbatim
The LTC®4155 is a 15 watt I²C controlled power manager with PowerPath™ instant-
on operation, high efficiency switching battery charging and USB compatibility.
The LTC4155 seamlessly manages power distribution from two 5V sources, such as a
USB port and a wall adapter, to a single-cell rechargeable Lithium-Ion/Polymer
battery and a system load.

/*! @file
 *  @ingroup LTC4155
 *  @brief LTC4155 communication library core header file defining
 *  prototypes, data structures and constants used by LTC4155.c
 *
 *  Functions  matching  the  prototypes  of  @ref  smbus_write_register and @ref
 *  smbus_read_register  must  be  provided  to this API. They will implement the
 *  SMBus  read  and write transactions on your hardware. If the register size of
 *  the  LTC4155  is 8 bits, functions should be provided that implement SMBus
 *  read  byte and write byte. If the register size of the LTC4155 is 16 bits,
 *  functions  should  be provided that implement SMBus read word and write word.
 *  smbus_read_register  needs  to  store the value read from the LTC4155 into
 *  the  variable  data.  Both  functions  should return 0 on success and a non-0
 *  error  code  on  failure.  The  API functions will return your error codes on
 *  failure and a 0 on success.

    Multiple LTC4155s can be used with this API. Each one must be initialized.
    The LTC4155_init requires some memory for each LTC4155. This memory can
    be  statically  allocated  by  defining  MAX_NUM_LTC4155_INSTANCES  to the
    number of LTC4155s required. Alternatively it can be dynamically allocated
    by  defining  LTC4155_USE_MALLOC.  The  default  is  to not use malloc and
    statically allocate one LTC4155.
