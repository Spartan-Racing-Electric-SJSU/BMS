LTC4245: Hot Swap Controller with I2C Compatible Monitoring

@verbatim

The LTC4245 Hot Swap controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane. Using an external N-channel pass transistor, board supply
voltage and inrush current are ramped up at an adjustable rate. An I2C interface
and onboard ADC allow for monitoring of load current, voltage and fault status.
