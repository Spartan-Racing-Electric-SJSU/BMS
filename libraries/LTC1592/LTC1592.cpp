LTC1592: 16-bit SoftSpan DAC with Programmable Output Range

@verbatim

The LTC1592 is a 16-bit serial input DAC that operates on a single 5V supply.
It can be software-programmed for either unipolar or bipolar mode. It can
also be programmed for different output voltage ranges - two output ranges in
unipolar mode and four output ranges in bipolar mode.

The device includes an internal deglitcher circuit that reduces the glitch
impulse to less than 2nV-s (typ).

When the CS/LD is brought to a logic low, the data on the SDI input is loaded
into the shift register on the rising edge of the clock.  A 4-bit command word
(C3 C2 C1 C0), followed by four “don’t care” bits and 16 data bits(MSB-first)
is the minimum loading sequence required. When the CS/LD is brought to a logic
high, the clock is disabled internally and the command word is executed.

SPI DIN FORMAT (MSB First):

Byte #1                     Byte #2                        Byte #3
C3 C2 C1 C0  X  X   X   X   D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8  D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0
