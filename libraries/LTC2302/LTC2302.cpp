LTC2302: 12-Bit, 1-Channel 500ksps SAR ADC with SPI Interface.

@verbatim

The LTC2302 is a single-channel 12-bit A/D converter with with serial I/O.
The part can be configured to operate on unipolar or bipolar modes. The
automatic sleep mode benefits power sensitive applications.

SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                           Byte #2
Data In  :   X  OS   X   X  UNI  X    X   X    X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X
Data Out :  D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10  D9  D8   D7  D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0

OS   : ODD/Sign Bit
UNI  : Unipolar/Bipolar Bit
Dx   : Data Bits
X    : Don't care
