LTC2308: 12-Bit 8-Channel 200ksps ADC

@verbatim

The LTC2308 is an 8-channel 12-bit A/D converter with
serial I/O, and an internal reference. The ADCs typically draw only 1.3mA from a
single 5V supply. The 8-channel input multiplexer can be configured for either
single-ended or differential inputs and unipolar or bipolar conversions (or
combinations thereof). The automatic nap and sleep modes benefit power sensitive
applications.

The LTC2308's DC performance is outstanding with a +/-2LSB INL specification and
no missing codes over temperature. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the
LTC2308 is typically 89dB, with the internal reference.
