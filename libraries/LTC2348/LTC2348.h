@verbatim

The LTC2348 is an 18-bit,low noise 8-channel simultaneous sampling successive
approximation register(SAR) ADC with differential,wide common mode range
inputs. Operating from a 5V low voltage supply, flexible high voltage supplies,
and using the internal reference and buffer, each channel of this SoftSpan ADC
can be independently configured on a conversion-by-conversion basis to accept
±10.24V, 0V to 10.24V, ±5.12V,or 0V to 5.12V signals. Individual channels may
also be disabled to increase throughput on the remaining channels
