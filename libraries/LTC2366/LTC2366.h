@verbatim

The following parts (DUT) are pin-compatible, 12-bit A/D converters with serial I/O, and an internal reference:
LTC2360-12: 12-Bit, 100Ksps ADC.
LTC2361-12: 12-Bit, 250Ksps ADC.
LTC2362-12: 12-Bit, 500Ksps ADC
LTC2365-12: 12-Bit, 1Msps ADC
LTC2366-12: 12-Bit, 3Msps ADC

Example Code:

Read ADC input.

    LTC2366_read(LTC2366_CS, &adc_code);   // Throws out last reading
    LTC2366_read(LTC2366_CS, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2366_code_to_voltage(adc_code, vref);
