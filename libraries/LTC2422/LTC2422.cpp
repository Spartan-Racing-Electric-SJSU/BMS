LTC2422: 1-/2-Channel 20-Bit uPower No Latency Delta-Sigma ADC in MSOP-10

@verbatim

The LTC2421/LTC2422 are 1- and 2-channel 2.7V to 5.5V micropower 20-bit analog-
to-digital converters with an integrated oscillator, 8ppm INL and 1.2ppm RMS
noise. These ultrasmall devices use delta-sigma technology and a new digital
filter architecture that settles in a single cycle. This eliminates the latency
found in conventional delta-sigma converters and simplifies multiplexed
applications. Through a single pin, the LTC2421/LTC2422 can be configured for
better than 110dB rejection at 50Hz or 60Hz +/-2%, or can be driven by an
external oscillator for a user defined rejection frequency in the range 1Hz to
120Hz. The internal oscillator requires no external frequency setting
components.
