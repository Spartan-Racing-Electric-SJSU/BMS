LTC2422: 1-/2-Channel 20-Bit uPower No Latency Delta-Sigma ADC in MSOP-10

@verbatim

The LTC2421/LTC2422 are 1- and 2-channel 2.7V to 5.5V micropower 20-bit analog-
to-digital converters with an integrated oscillator, 8ppm INL and 1.2ppm RMS
noise. These ultrasmall devices use delta-sigma technology and a new digital
filter architecture that settles in a single cycle. This eliminates the latency
found in conventional delta-sigma converters and simplifies multiplexed
applications. Through a single pin, the LTC2421/LTC2422 can be configured for
better than 110dB rejection at 50Hz or 60Hz +/-2%, or can be driven by an
external oscillator for a user defined rejection frequency in the range 1Hz to
120Hz. The internal oscillator requires no external frequency setting
components.

SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                            Byte #2

Data Out :  !EOC CH SIG EXR D19 D18 D17 D16   D15  D14  D13  D12  D11  D10 D9  D8
Data In  :  X    X   X   X   X   X   X   X     X    X    X    X    X    X   X   X

Byte #3
D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0
X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X

!EOC : End of Conversion Bit (Active Low)
CH   : Channel Indicator Bit (0 - CH0 , 1 - CH1)
SIG  : Sign Bit (1-data positive, 0-data negative)
EXR  : Extebded Input Range Indicator Bit
Dx   : Data Bits

Example Code:

Read Channel 0.

    uint16_t miso_timeout = 1000;
    if(LTC2422_EOC_timeout(LTC2422_CS, miso_timeout))        // Check for EOC
        return; // Handle exception if timeout exceeded without EOC
    LTC2422_adc_read(LTC2422_CS, &adc_channel, &adc_code);  // Read ADC

    if(adc_channel != 0)
    {
        if(LTC2422_EOC_timeout(LTC2422_CS, miso_timeout))    // Check for EOC
            return; // Handle exception if timeout exceeded without EOC
        LTC2422_adc_read(LTC2422_CS, &adc_channel, &adc_code); // Reads the ADC again if the first reading was not CH0
    }
    adc_voltage = LTC2422_code_to_voltage(adc_code, LTC2422_lsb);
