LTC2440: 24-Bit, Differential Delta Sigma ADCs with Selectable Speed/Resolution.

@verbatim

The LTC2440 is a high speed 24-bit No Latency Delta Sigma TM ADC with 5ppm
INL and 5uV offset. It uses proprietary delta-sigma architecture enabling
variable speed and resolution with no latency. Ten speed/resolution
combinations (6.9Hz/200nVRMS to 3.5kHz/25uVRMS) are programmed through a
simple serial interface. Alternatively, by tying a single pin HIGH or
LOW, a fast (880Hz/2uVRMS) or ultralow noise (6.9Hz, 200nVRMS, 50/60Hz
rejection) speed/resolution combination can be easily selected. The
accuracy (offset, full-scale, linearity, drift) and power dissipation are
independent of the speed selected. Since there is no latency, a
speed/resolution change may be made between conversions with no
degradation in performance.
