LTC2460 Ultra-Tiny, 16-bit delta sigma ADCs with 10ppm/degree C Max Precision Reference

@verbatim

The LTC2460/LTC2462 are ultra tiny, 16-Bit analog-to- digital converters
with an integrated precision reference. They use a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply
and communicate through an SPI Interface. The LTC2460 is single-ended with
a 0V to VREF input range and the LTC2462 is differential with a ±VREF input
range. Both ADC’s include a 1.25V integrated reference with 2ppm/°C drift
performance and 0.1% initial accuracy. The converters are available in a
12-pin DFN 3mm × 3mm package or an MSOP-12 package. They include an integrated
oscillator and perform conversions with no latency for multiplexed applications.
The LTC2460/LTC2462 include a proprietary input sampling scheme that reduces
the average input current several orders of magnitude when compared to conventional
delta sigma converters.
