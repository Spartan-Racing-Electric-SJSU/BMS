LTC2460 Ultra-Tiny, 16-bit delta sigma ADCs with 10ppm/degree C Max Precision Reference

@verbatim

The LTC2460/LTC2462 are ultra tiny, 16-Bit analog-to- digital converters
with an integrated precision reference. They use a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply
and communicate through an SPI Interface. The LTC2460 is single-ended with
a 0V to VREF input range and the LTC2462 is differential with a ±VREF input
range. Both ADC’s include a 1.25V integrated reference with 2ppm/°C drift
performance and 0.1% initial accuracy. The converters are available in a
12-pin DFN 3mm × 3mm package or an MSOP-12 package. They include an integrated
oscillator and perform conversions with no latency for multiplexed applications.
The LTC2460/LTC2462 include a proprietary input sampling scheme that reduces
the average input current several orders of magnitude when compared to conventional
delta sigma converters.


SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                            Byte #2

Data Out :  D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8   D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D10
Data In  :  EN1 EN2 SPD SLP  X   X  X  X    X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X


Dx   : Data Bits
EN1/EN2   : Enable Bits (00-keep previous mode, 10-change mode)
SPD  : Double Output Rate Select Bit (1-Normal rate 30hz, auto-calibration on, 0- 2x rate 60hz, auto_calibration off)
SLP : 1 - powers down chip reference after the next conversion is complete
Command Byte #1
EN1  EN2  SPD  SLP  Comments
0    X    X    X    Keep Previous Mode
1    0    1    X    60 Hz conversion
1    0    0    X    30 Hz auto-calibrated conversion

Example Code:

Read in 2X mode without turning off reference

    uint16_t miso_timeout = 1000;
    adc_command =LTC2460_SPEED_2X | LTC2460_REF_ON;   // Build ADC command for channel 0

    LTC2460_read(LTC2460_CS, adc_command, &adc_code);    // Throws out last reading
    delay(50);
    LTC2460_read(LTC2460_CS, adc_command, &adc_code);    // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable
    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2460_code_to_voltage(adc_code, LTC2460_lsb);
