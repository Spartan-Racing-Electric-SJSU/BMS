LTC2473: 16-Bit, Delta Sigma ADC with I2C interface.

@verbatim

The LTC2471/LTC2473 are small, 16-bit analog-to-digital converters with an
integrated precision reference and a selectable 208sps or 833sps output
rate. They use a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply and communicate through an I2C
Interface. The LTC2471 is single-ended with a 0V to VREF input range and
the LTC2473 is differential with a +-VREF input range. Both ADC's include
a 1.25V integrated reference with 2ppm/C drift performance and 0.1% initial
accuracy. They include an integrated oscillator and perform conversions with
no latency for multiplexed applications. The LTC2471/LTC2473 include a
proprietary input sampling scheme that reduces the average input current
several orders of magnitude when compared to conventional delta sigma
converters.

    uint16_t timeout = 300; // timeout in microseconds
    float adc_voltage;
    acknowledge = LTC2473_read(i2c_address, &adc_code, timeout);

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2473_code_to_voltage(adc_code, LTC2473_lsb, LTC2473_offset_code);
