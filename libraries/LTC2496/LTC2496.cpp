LTC2496: 16-Bit 8-/16-Channel Delta Sigma ADC with Easy Drive Input Current Cancellation

@verbatim

The LTC2496 is a 16-channel (8-differential) 16-bit No Latency ΔΣ ADC with Easy
Drive technology. The patented sampling scheme eliminates dynamic input current
errors and the shortcomings of on-chip buffering through automatic cancellation
of differential input current. This allows large external source impedances,
and rail-to-rail input signals to be directly digitized while maintaining
exceptional DC accuracy.

The LTC2496 includes an integrated oscillator. This device can be configured to
measure an external signal (from combinations of 16 analog input channels
operating in single ended or differential modes). It automatically rejects
line frequencies of 50Hz and 60Hz, simultaneously.
