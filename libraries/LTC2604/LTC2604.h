LTC2604: Quad 16-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs in 16-Lead SSOP

@verbatim

The LTC2604/LTC2614/LTC2624 are quad 16-,14- and 12-bit 2.5V to 5.5V
rail-to-rail voltage output DACs in 16-lead narrow SSOP packages. These
parts have separate reference inputs for each DAC. They have built-in
high performance output buffers and are guaranteed monotonic.

These parts establish advanced performance standards for output drive,
crosstalk and load regulation in single-supply, voltage output multiples.

Cx   : DAC Command Code
Ax   : DAC Address (0=DACA, 1=DACB, 2=DACC, 3=DACD, 0xFF=All DACs)
Dx   : DAC Data Bits
X    : Don't care


Example Code:

Set DAC A to to 2V for 16-bit DAC.

    shift_count = 0;    // 16-bit DAC does not have to be shifted
    dac_voltage = 2.0;  // Sets dac voltage variable to 2v

    dac_code = LTC2604_voltage_to_code(dac_voltage, LTC2604_lsb, LTC2604_offset);       // Calculate DAC code from voltage, lsb, and offset
    LTC2604_write(LTC2604_CS, LTC2604_CMD_WRITE_UPDATE, LTC2604_DAC_A, dac_code << shift_count);    // Set DAC A with DAC code
