LTC2642: 16-/14-/12-Bit VOUT DAC with SPI Interface
LTC2641: 16-/14-/12-Bit VOUT DAC with SPI Interface

@verbatim

The LTC2641/LTC2642 are families of 16-,14 and 12-bit unbuffered voltage output
DACs. These DACs operate from 2.7V to 5.5V supply and are monotonic over
temperature.

Both the LTC2641 and LTC2642 feature a reference input range of 2V to VDD. VOUT
swings from 0V to VREF . For bipolar operation, the LTC2642 includes matched scaling
resistors for use with an external precision op amp (such as the LT1678), generating
a ±VREF output swing at RFB.

They communicate via SPI interface. 16 bits of data are loaded through DIN
after a high-to-low transition of CS (MSB first). After 16 data bits have
been loaded into the serial input register, a low-to-high transition on CS
transfers the data to the 16-bit DAC latch, updating the DAC output.

For the 14-bit DACs, (LTC2641-14/LTC2642-14), the MSB remains in the same
(left-justified) position in the input 16-bit data word. Therefore, two
“don’t-care” bits must be loaded after the LSB, to make up the required
16 data bits. Similarly, for the 12-bit family members(LTC2641-12/LTC2642-12)
four “don’t-care” bits must follow the LSB.
