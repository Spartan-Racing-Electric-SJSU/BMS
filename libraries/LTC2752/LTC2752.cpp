LTC2752: Dual Serial 16-Bit SoftSpan IOUT DAC

@verbatim

The LTC2752 is a dual, current-output, serial-input precision multiplying DAC
with selectable output ranges. Ranges can either be programmed in software for
maximum flexibility (each of the DACs can be programmed to any one of six output
ranges) or hardwired through pin-strapping. Two unipolar ranges are available
(0V to 5V and 0V to 10V), and four bipolar ranges (±2.5V, ±5V, ±10V and –2.5V
to 7.5V). These ranges are obtained when an external precision 5V reference is
used. The output ranges for other reference voltages are easy to calculate by
observing that each range is a multiple of the external reference voltage. The
ranges can then be expressed: 0 to 1×, 0 to 2×, ±0.5×, ±1×, ±2×, and –0.5× to 1.5×.
