LTC6602: Dual, Matched, High Frequency Bandpass/Lowpass Filters

@verbatim

The LTC6602 is a dual, matched, programmable bandpass or lowpass filter
and differential driver. The selectivity of the LTC6602, combined with its
phase matching and dynamic range, make it ideal for filtering in RFID
systems. With two degree phase matching between channels, the LTC6602 can
be used in applications requiring highly matched filters, such as
transceiver I and Q channels. Gain programmability, and the fully
differential inputs and outputs, simplify implementation in most systems.
