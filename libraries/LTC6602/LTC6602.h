LTC6602: Dual, Matched, High Frequency Bandpass/Lowpass Filters

@verbatim

The LTC6602 is a dual, matched, programmable bandpass or lowpass filter
and differential driver. The selectivity of the LTC6602, combined with its
phase matching and dynamic range, make it ideal for filtering in RFID
systems. With two degree phase matching between channels, the LTC6602 can
be used in applications requiring highly matched filters, such as
transceiver I and Q channels. Gain programmability, and the fully
differential inputs and outputs, simplify implementation in most systems.

SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                                      Byte #2

Data In  :  GAIN0 GAIN1 LPF0 LPF1 HPF0 HPF1 SHDN OUT     GAIN0 GAIN1 LPF0 LPF1 HPF0 HPF1 SHDN OUT
            |---- GAIN, BW CONTROL WORD FOR #2 ----|     |---- GAIN, BW CONTROL WORD FOR #1 ----|

GAINx : Gain Control Bits
LPFx  : Lowpass Cutoff Frequency Bits
HPFx  : Highpass Cutoff Frequency Bits
SHDN  : Shutdown Bit
OUT   : General Purpose Output Pin
