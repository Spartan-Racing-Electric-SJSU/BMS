LTM9100: Anyside™ High Voltage Isolated Switch Controller with I²C Command and Telemetry

@verbatim

The LTM9100 μModule controller is a complete, galvanically isolated switch controller
with I2C interface, for use as a load switch or hot swap controller. The load is soft
started and controlled by an external N-channel MOSFET switch.
